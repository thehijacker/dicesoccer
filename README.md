## üéÆ About the Game

This game is a web-based recreation of Torj√§ger, a beloved board game that combines dice rolling with tactical soccer gameplay. Originally designed by Kosmos in Germany, this digital version allows players to enjoy the same strategic gameplay on any device - whether it's a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone.

The inspiration for this project came from countless hours playing the physical board game at home with family. Now, the game can be enjoyed anywhere, with special features like a unique portrait mode where two players can sit opposite each other sharing a single phone, with each player's view properly oriented for comfortable play.

## üìã Game Rules

### Objective
Be the first player to score **3 goals** by moving your soccer players across the field and into your opponent's goal or by preventing him to move any further.

### Gameplay Mechanics

1. **Dice Rolling**: Players take turns rolling a six-sided dice to determine which player piece they can move.

2. **Player Selection**: 
   - If you roll a number matching one of your player's shirt numbers (2-6), you must move that player if possible
   - Each team has two players of each number (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and one goalkeeper (1)
   - If no player with the rolled number can move, you may move any player that has a valid move available

3. **Movement Rules**:
   - Players can move forward (toward opponent's goal) or diagonally forward
   - Players can move only one space per turn
   - Players cannot move backward or sideways
   - Players cannot occupy the same space
   - Empty cells in the corners (first and last columns, except goal) cannot be entered

4. **Scoring**:
   - **Goal Scoring**: A goal is scored when a player piece reaches the opponent's goal cell (middle cell of the first/last column)
   - **Blocking Victory**: A player also scores if their opponent has no valid moves available (all opponent pieces are blocked)
   - After scoring (by either method), the round resets with all players returning to their starting positions
   - The player who lost the previous round starts the next round
   - First player to reach 3 goals wins the match

5. **Game Statistics**:
   After a match ends (first player to reach 3 goals), detailed statistics are displayed:
   - **Final Score**: Points scored by each player (winner: 3 points)
   - **Thinking Time**: Total time each player took to make their moves (measured from dice roll to piece movement)
     - Helps track decision-making speed and strategic planning time
     - Only counts active thinking time, not waiting time between rounds
   - **Total Moves**: Total number of piece movements made by the winning player throughout the match
   - **Total Game Time**: Complete duration of the match from start to finish
   - Statistics are displayed in hours:minutes:seconds format (h:m:s) for times over 60 seconds

6. **Strategy**:
   - **Offense**: Create clear paths to the goal, position players strategically for goal-scoring opportunities
   - **Defense**: Block opponent's forward progress, protect your goalkeeper, trap opponent pieces in corners
   - **Positioning**: Middle rows offer more movement flexibility than edge rows
   - **Blocking**: Strategically position your pieces to eliminate all opponent's possible moves and score without reaching their goal

  <img src="screenshots/aidifficulty.png" alt="AI Difficulty" width="400"/>
</p>

#### AI Difficulty Levels

**Easy**:
- Random player selection and movement
- No strategic evaluation
- Great for beginners and casual play
- AI makes completely random decisions from available moves

**Normal**:
- Hybrid strategy: 70% strategic, 30% random
- Evaluates basic offensive positioning (moving toward goal)
- Considers some defensive aspects (goal protection)
- Good balance between challenge and winability
- Occasionally makes suboptimal moves for unpredictability

**Hard**:
- Fully strategic AI with advanced evaluation
- **Offensive Strategy**:
  - Prioritizes direct paths to goal
  - Evaluates clear forward routes
  - Prefers middle rows for flexibility
  - Calculates optimal timing for goal approaches
- **Defensive Strategy**:
  - Protects goalkeeper position
  - Blocks opponent's forward progress
  - Evaluates threats and maintains blocking positions
  - Attempts to trap opponent pieces in corners
  - Guards goal area with multiple defenders
- **Blocking Victory Strategy**:
  - Actively evaluates moves that would eliminate ALL opponent moves
  - Simulates each potential move to check if opponent would be completely blocked
  - Prioritizes complete blocking scenarios almost as highly as scoring goals
  - Recognizes when opponent has very few moves left (1-2) and works to eliminate them
  - Balances between advancing to goal vs. blocking opponent's ability to move
- **Tactical Evaluation**:
  - Scores each possible move combination
  - Considers consequences of leaving positions
  - Evaluates immediate goal opportunities (highest priority)
  - Evaluates complete blocking opportunities (second highest priority)
  - Calculates opponent threats after each potential move
  - Balances offense and defense dynamically

### 3. Multiplayer Network Game

Both settings are accessible from the Settings menu in the main menu and persist across game sessions.

#### Hints Mode
When starting a new game (local or multiplayer), you can choose your preferred difficulty level:

**Play with Hints** (Default):
- **Movable players highlighted**: After rolling the dice, all players that can be moved are visually highlighted on the board
- **Valid moves shown**: When you select a player, all possible destination cells are highlighted
- **Easier gameplay**: Perfect for beginners, learning the game, or casual play
- **Less challenging**: Reduces need to mentally calculate which pieces can move and where

**Play without Hints** (Challenge Mode):
- **No movable player highlighting**: After rolling the dice, you must look at the dice number and manually find matching players on the board
- **No move destination highlighting**: When you select a player, you must figure out valid move positions yourself
- **Selected player indicator**: The player you select IS still highlighted (shows who you clicked/tapped)
- **Warning messages still work**: If you try to move an invalid player, you still get error messages
- **Significantly more challenging**: Requires careful attention to dice rolls and board state
- **Strategic depth**: Forces players to think ahead and remember piece positions
- **Better game knowledge**: Helps players learn movement rules more thoroughly

**Multiplayer Synchronization**:
- In multiplayer games, the **host's hints preference is applied to both players**
- When hosting a game, your hints selection determines the difficulty for the entire match
- Guests automatically receive the same hints setting as the host
- Ensures fair gameplay with identical difficulty for both players

**Use Cases**:
- **With Hints**: Teaching new players, casual gaming, quick matches
- **Without Hints**: Competitive play, skill improvement, tournament-style games, maximum challenge

Settings can be changed for each new game, allowing flexibility based on mood and opponent skill level.
